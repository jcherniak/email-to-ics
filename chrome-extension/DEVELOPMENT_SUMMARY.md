3. **API Integration Tests** - OpenRouter and Postmark API validation  
4. **End-to-End Testing** - Complete workflow validation

### ✅ Documentation & Support
1. **Installation Guide** - Comprehensive setup instructions
2. **User Manual** - Usage instructions and troubleshooting
3. **Developer Documentation** - Code structure and API references
4. **Browser Compatibility Matrix** - Supported features by platform

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Original Architecture (Server-dependent)
```
Browser → PHP Server → OpenRouter API → Postmark API
```

### New Architecture (Standalone)
```
Browser Extension → Direct API Calls → Email Delivery
```

### Key Components

1. **EmailProcessor Class** (`email-processor.js`)
   - Handles AI processing, ICS generation, and email sending
   - Manages API keys and settings
   - Implements caching and error handling

2. **Background Script** (`background.js` / `background-orion.js`)
   - Service worker for Chrome, persistent background for Orion
   - Message passing and screenshot handling
   - Context menu integration

3. **Content Script** (`content.js`)
   - Iframe injection for persistent UI
   - Screenshot coordination (hide/show during capture)
   - Cross-frame communication

4. **Popup Interface** (`popup.js` / `popup-orion.js`)
   - Form handling and user interaction
   - Settings management
   - Browser-specific compatibility handling

## 🔄 Migration Benefits

### Before (PHP Server Required)
- ❌ Required PHP 8.4+ server
- ❌ Complex deployment with Apache/Nginx
- ❌ Server maintenance and hosting costs
- ❌ HTTP Basic Auth dependency
- ❌ Limited to single domain access

### After (Standalone Extension)
- ✅ No server required - fully client-side
- ✅ Simple browser extension installation
- ✅ Works on any website
- ✅ Secure API key storage in browser
- ✅ Offline capable (after initial setup)
- ✅ Cross-platform support (Chrome + Orion)

## 🌟 Key Features Implemented

### AI-Powered Event Extraction
- Multiple AI model support (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
- Structured JSON output with validation
- Custom instructions and context awareness
- Screenshot integration for visual content

### Calendar Integration
- Standard ICS file generation
- Support for all-day and timed events
- Tentative/confirmed status handling
- Timezone support
- Multi-day event capability

### Email Delivery
- Automatic calendar invite sending
- Customizable recipient addresses
- Email templates with event details
- Base64 attachment encoding
- Delivery confirmation

### User Experience
- Persistent iframe UI (survives tab switches)
- One-click processing from any webpage
- Context menu integration
- Review mode for event confirmation
- Settings persistence across devices
